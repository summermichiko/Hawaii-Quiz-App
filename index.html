			<h2 class="pronunciation">Kama`aina  [kah-mah-EYE-nah]</h2>
			<p class="pos">noun</p>
			<p class="definition">"Kama`aina", meaning "child of the land," derives from the words "kama", meaning "child", and "ʻāina", meaning 'land'. Kamaʻaina in the traditional sense is someone born in Hawaiʻi or who has made their residence in the islands for many years. The word "kamaʻaina" describes Hawaiʻi residents regardless of their racial background, as opposed to "kanaka" which refers to a person of native Hawaiian ancestry. More recently, the definition of a kamaʻaina has been expanded to include anyone who currently lives in Hawaiʻi, or who once lived there but has moved away. Take the quiz and find out if you're kama`aina! Good luck!</p>
